# E-commerce shop whit books

This project is a typical reflection of a store, where you can choose the right book , as well as get additional information. Also we can filter by products, and add to our cart

The project , which is constantly being developed in terms of frontend as well as backend. The project initially assumed a simple store where you could filter by products and you could get additional information about the selected product , but over time I decided to create a backend as well. As part of this premise, I decided to create registration, login.

## What next

To the project I would like to add an admin dashboard , where the admin would only have access , he could edit , create or delete a product from the store. Improve and develop the backand the key point would be JWT and storing user data in cookies. On the frontend I would like to add a multiple choice filter and much more
